A simple classic game where you try to keep the resources at the base from running out. You have to collect barrels of resources in open space and deliver them to your base.

Try it, share your feedback and best scores in the comments on [itch.io](https://yuriy-danyliuk.itch.io/space-survival) and have fun!
